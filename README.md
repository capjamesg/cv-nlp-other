# Computer Vision, NLP, or Other

The code behind my text classification model that identifies whether a piece of text relates to computer vision, NLP, or something else.

This project uses [Autodistill](https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill) to auto-label a JSON file that contains text to classify. Then, the classified text is passed into a SetFit model.

Here are the final results from the project:

- [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/capjamesg/cv-nlp-other)
